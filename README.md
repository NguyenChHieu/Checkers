+ Checkers is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid.
+ Each player starts with 12 pieces (checkers) placed on the dark squares of the board.
+ Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward toward the opponent's side of the board.
+ A piece may only move forward diagonally to an adjacent empty square.
+ If a player's piece reaches the opponent's back row, it becomes a "king" and gains the ability to move diagonally backward.
+ Players can capture their opponent's pieces by jumping over them diagonally.
+ Captured pieces are removed from the board.
+ The game ends when one player captures all of their opponent's pieces or when one player is unable to make a legal move.
